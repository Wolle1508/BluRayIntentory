# BluRayInventory
A Node.js/Electron Application with a MySQL 5.7 Community Database to manage a Blu-ray Collection.


A little practice project i started to keep my programming game up during a dull semester. Not intended to be taken seriously.
Purely intended to practise my JS Programming and experimenting with Node.js, Electron and now git. 

This branch will use SQLite as its Database, so if you want to us it, you will be needing the scheme as i will not put up my db or sql files for
privacy reasons.
