# BluRayIntentory
A Node.js/Electron Application with a MySQL 5.7 Community Database to manage a Blu-Ray Collection.


A little practice project i started by me to keep my programming game up during a dull semester. Not intended to be taken seriously.
Purely intended to practise my JS Programming and experimenting with Node.js and Electron.
